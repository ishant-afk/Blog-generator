<h1>This File contains the details about the whole project <h1> <br>
In this repo you will find two files first will be ContentGeneration_1.ipynb, I have created this file by following instructions from a youtuber<br>
This file has some unnecessary codes too, that are there just to demonstrate some working or some errors to avoid<br>
<br>
The usable file is the second one that is ContentGeneration_2.ipynb, in this file I have updated some of the parameters in the "sample" part according to my usage, These parameters are:<br>
repetition_penalty and diversity_penalty <br>
Here we have updated them to remove the repetation in the content that is being generated to get a better experience to the user, If we are still getting more repetetion we can update these parameters by increasing the repetetion_penalty and decreasing the diversity_penality<br>
If we want to change the word limit we can change the max_length parameter to get the required output.
